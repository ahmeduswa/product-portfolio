                    Quill Flow is a home decor and gift brand that specializes in wall art, printed mugs, and thoughtfully designed cards. We believe that art 
                    should be a part of everyday life and we strive to create original and unique designs which are printed 
                    on a variety of surfaces.
                    Quill Flow has positioned itself as a customer-centric company. As of now, we have a website and a social
                    media presence where people can shop our products from. We offer custom and ready-made designs depending on customer preferences.
                    The idea behind Quill Flow is that the Quill symbolizes the medium through which our ideas come into existence and the word Flow represents imagination and the artistic journey.
                    Time and effort is put into our designs which are then imprinted on to the final product, whether they are mugs, wall art or greeting cards. Each one of our designs not only represents creative
                    expression, but also our commitment to our values and to establish a connection with our customers.
                    Including our online presence, we are seeking to open a pop up shop where customers can view our items physically and share the experience of quality decor and gifts.
